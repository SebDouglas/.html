    What I learn't during this quarter was quite astonishing, it was a series and of confusion <br>
    and accomplishments. Personally I am not untelligable enough to comprehend such topic, but <br>
    if I were to be completely honest, I'm glad that I get to learn such topic as it could help <br>
    me in the near future. My opinions on our teacher is quite extremely positive, even if I barely <br>
    get the topic, she teachers it with full detail and as someone who has full experience with. <br>
    That is all for my reflection thank you for reading this and have a good time.
